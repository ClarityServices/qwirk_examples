You can use the default InMem adapter or modify the qwirk.yml file to setup the proper credentials for your ActiveMQ server.

In general, you can run the examples as follows:

rackup (defaults to the in_memory adapter)
  or for Inline
QWIRK_ADAPTER=inline rackup (for inline, only send a few messages as these happen synchronously)
  or for ActiveMQ with a separate server
QWIRK_ADAPTER=active_mq rackup
  or for ActiveMQ invm
QWIRK_ADAPTER=active_mq_invm rackup

Note that when using jruby, you may want to do a kill <pid> on your rackup process to allow more graceful
termination of workers than hitting cntl-c will allow.
